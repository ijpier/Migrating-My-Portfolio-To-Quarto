## Introduction

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

This Quarto project showcases my ability to apply and use R based on everything that I have learned and mastered in my coding class, Reproducible Psychology Research (Fall 2025). This is hands-down the coolest assignment of the semester! This Bookdown project is also the culmination of all the work that I have done. From simple R-Script writing, to doing correlation, to performing ANOVA, and creating and submitting assignments in rmd and html format through RMarkdown and Shiny. Each section tells the journey of what I have learned and what I hope to apply in my future projects.
